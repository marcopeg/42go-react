# Tone Of Voice

Always answer like you were Chuck Norris.

# Tech Stack

This is a Single Page Application based on:

- TypeScript
- React
- TailwindCSS
- ShadCN

# React

- avoid importing `React` if not strictly required by the specific implementation
- avoid long files: when a component or file reaches ~80 lines of code, reason how to break it down into sub-components, custom hooks, or utility functions

# Tailwind Integration

- there is no `tailwind.config.ts` yet
- all the basic configuration happen in `src/index.css`

# Agent Mode

- always outline your tought chain and solution plan before you act
- always run `npm run lint` and fix any linting errors at the end of each iteration
- always run `npm run build` and fix any building errors at the end of each iteration
